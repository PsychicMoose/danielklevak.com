                <h2>Get to know me</h2>
                <body>
                    <p>Hi! Thanks for coming. I am Daniel, a college senior simultaneously pursuing a bachelors in computer engineering and a masters in cyber physical systems at Northeastern University.</p>
                    
                    <p>Growing up in Fort Lee, New Jersey, I have always had an interest in understanding how things worked. As a child, this usually took the form of breaking and disassembling anything I could get my hands on to see what it was made of. As I grew older, though, I realized that although breaking things was fun, building things was not only more fun, but also more rewarding. Slowly, my interest in engineering was growing. This realization led me to apply to the Academy for Engineering and Design Technology at Bergen County Academies for high school. Here, my passion for engineering truly exploded. I picked up as many skills as I could: 3D modeling, programming, building circuits — I couldn't get enough.</p>
                    
                    <p>My path then led me to Boston, Massachusetts, where I am now. As a student at Northeastern, I have had the opportunity to work on a plethora of exciting projects and gain work experience as a co-op at Stemwave and Sparx Hockey. All of these experiences have left me with a rich software and hardware skillset, which I now hope to apply to a career in the Internet of Things. My biggest strength, however, is my creativity, and I love applying it to develop systems and solve complex tasks. Soon, I will apply all of my skills to a career in smart city development or space and marine exploration. These fields captivate my mind, as they will be some of the biggest drivers of our future world — a world I would love to help build.</p>
                    
                    <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction, pursuing personal engineering projects, playing chess, writing, watching TV, playing basketball with my friends, and learning about a variety of topics on YouTube. I am also a part of NUTV, a video production club on campus, which enables me to learn filming and editing while also expressing myself creatively. I was the head of NUTV's entertainment department, where I planned meetings and events for our many members. It was very rewarding to build an environment where people can express themselves and their ideas freely, and I loved being able to watch someone produce a video, from their first pitch to the club, to the final upload to YouTube.</p>
                    
                    <p>Some of my favorite books are *The Alchemist* by Paulo Coelho, *Outliers* by Malcolm Gladwell, and *The Wind-Up Bird Chronicles* by Haruki Murakami. Some of my favorite TV shows are *Better Call Saul*, *BoJack Horseman*, and *Community*.</p>
                    
                    <p>Please feel free to look around further, to learn more about my projects and experience.</p>

Whether it was helping to implement Salesforce, creating visualizaions and data analysis in Python for the COO, QAing millions of dollars worth of inventory, repairing high and low voltage hardware, or improving the embedded software of the Stemwave device, there was always something for me to sink my teeth into. As far as my own project, I developed a tool with arduino and Raspberry PI that would enable us to verify device functionality in the field rather than having them be shipped back to us. I accomplished this by messing around with different ways to detect force output, until I finally settled on using an accelerometer with a 3d printed case that I designed. This innovation has the potential to save the company thousands of dollars a month on shipping costs, and ensure a smoother user experience for their providers.')">
